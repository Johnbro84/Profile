    <h2 id=Programming_Skills> Programming Skills </h2>
        <p> When I first switched my major to IT, I started to learn about programming in CUS 1115. I was on a rocky start <br>
        at first, but as soon as I learned more about it. I started to get the hang of it and really improved my coding <br>
        by the time I got into CUS 1116. As of now, my programming is at a great level where my improvement was through <br>
        trial and error. </p>

    <h2 id=General_Interests> General Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p> Some of my general hobbies or Interests that I like to do on my freetime involve watching sports. Some of my favorite <br>
        sports include football and baseball where I like to watch the NY Giants and Mets either on TV or at the games. <br>
        Watching TV is also another hobby that I like to do on my own time. I like to play video games mostly Mario, Kirby and Pokemon. <br>
        I like to hangout with my friends either in person or online like chatting on Discord. I used to do Karate during my public school <br>
        days, where I managed to earn Black Belt rank, but I haven't returned ever since the pandemic started. </p>
